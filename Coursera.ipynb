    "#### What is data processing\n",
    "    - We have data, but we need something to process data so we can gain information.\n",
    "* In big data\n",
    "    - Volume is huge\n",
    "    - Data keeps growing at staggering rate\n",
    "    - Data comes in variery of sources and fromats.\n",
    "* Scalable data processing\n",
    "    - Allows database processing system to cope with volume, velocity and variety.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example of data processing system\n",
    "    - RDBMS\n",
    "    - NoSQL\n",
    "    - Hadoop, Spark\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What is database?\n",
    "    - A very large integrated collection of data\n",
    "    - Models real world entities(students, course) and relationships (Purvil is taking CS101)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What is DBMS?\n",
    "    - We need some system to store data, retrieve data and manage (Insert, update) data.\n",
    "    - Benefits of DBMS\n",
    "        - Data independence: Does not need to know how data is stored, how it is organized. Only  care about application. DBMS takes care of all others.\n",
    "        - Efficient data access: No need to take care of how to index data\n",
    "        - Concurrent access and crash recovery\n",
    "        - Data consistency, integrity and security\n",
    "        - Control redundancy\n",
    "        - Reduced app development time : focus on logic of your own application\n",
    "        - Multiple user support\n",
    "        - Data independence : Ability to change implementation of database to be more efficient without affecting user interface.\n",
    "        - Backup and recovery\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Data model\n",
    "    - Structure or format of database.\n",
    "    - Collection of concepts that describe data\n",
    "    - Ex. Relational model (Model data using relation(table))\n",
    "    - Entity relationship model\n",
    "    - Hierarchical model (XML database use it)\n",
    "    - Data model has several aspects, data structure (schema, type of columns), Constraint (NOT NULL, UNIQUE, range of values) and  various allowed operations (changes and retrieval of data).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Schema\n",
    "- Description of a particular collection of data, using given data model\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Level of abstraction\n",
    "    - **Physical schema** : Describe how data is physically stored and organized in database. B+-tree, index on some column to retrieve it fast.\n",
    "    - **Logical schema (Conceptual schema)** : How data is logically represented. How table is set. What is the schema.\n",
    "    - **Views** : How user see the data. External schema. (Multiple views)\n",
    "        - Just a view, it has no physical existance in database.\n",
    "![](images/data_abstraction.jpg)\n",
    "    - Example: University database\n",
    "![](images/university_database.jpg)\n",
    "    - Logical data independence protects from changes in logical structure of data. Measure of how much we can change conceptual schema without affecting application program.\n",
    "    - Physical data independence protects from changes in physical structure of data. It is measure of how much the internal schema can change without affecting the application program\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Integrity\n",
    "    - Does database reflect reality well?\n",
    "#### Consistency\n",
    "    - Database without internal conflicts\n",
    "#### Metadata\n",
    "    - DBMS stores metadata like where data come from, how data were changes, how data are stored, who owns data, who can access data, data usage history, data usage statistics."
